= A bit about source code control =
Not only does source code control keep your files backed up for safe storage, it also allows you to collaborate on projects with others without worrying too much about overwriting other people's work. 

In particular, if two people edit the same file, but in different parts of the file, they can both commit their changes without affecting the others. 

It's important that everyone update their files they are editing locally to get the latest shared version from the repository. Other people may have made changes, and you will need to update your local copy.

= Checkout =
This is used generally the first time you start to use a project. If you want to 'start fresh' you can delete the project you have on your computer and check it out again. But that is more of a last resort.

= Update =
If you have already performed an initial checkout, your first task you will do each time you start editing the project is to perform an update. The update will update your local code with the newest versions of the code from the shared repository. Generally, this update won't change anything you have, but it's best do to this first thing before you start to edit the code.

= Commit =
When you have changes you want to save in the repository, you use 'commit'. This will allow others to see your work when they do their own 'update'.
